      <h3 class="title">Hi, hello</h3>
      <p>Hello from sunny Toronto, Canada, where we used to have a ridiculous number of craft breweries but the bottom fell out of that, and now we just have condos. I’m Katharine. </p>
      <p>I’m a front-end developer. I also have a little experience in back-end, some training in UX, but the front end is where my heart lies. I love building projects that people find useful, beautiful, and of course, accessible, and I strongly believe there's no conflict between those three things. </p>
      <p>I also have an extensive design background which lets me serve as the bridge between the worlds of design and code implementation, working closely with designers and UX people to build out design systems is where I really shine.</p>
      <p>I’m also a part-time instructor, teaching intro to web development, which is amazing: if you ever want to learn something really well, teach it to someone else. And if you ever want to relive the excitement and enthusiasm that first drew you to something? Again, teach it to someone else.</p>
      <p>If you scroll down a bit, you’ll see a few projects I’ve worked on recently that I’m proud of and excited to share, and also some things I’ve written. And below that, you can see how to get in touch – if you’d like to work together or just want to chat, I’d love to hear from you.</p>
      <p>What am I working with these days? What am I interested in and excited to learn more about at the moment? I’m glad you asked:</p>
